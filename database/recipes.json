This creamy, aromatic curry combines tender marinated chicken with a luxurious tomato-based sauce enriched with butter and cream. Perfect for both home cooks and dinner parties, this restaurant-quality dish delivers complex flavors through a harmonious blend of Indian spices. The magic lies in the two-stage cooking process: marinating the chicken for tenderness, then building a deeply flavored sauce that coats each piece beautifully.",

    "instructions": [
      "Marinate the chicken: Mix yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, and salt. Add chicken pieces and coat well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (or up to 4 hours for deeper flavor).",
      "Sear the chicken: Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, sear the marinated chicken for 3-4 minutes per side until golden brown. Don't overcrowd the pan. Remove and set aside.",
      "Temper the spices: In the same pan, heat remaining oil/ghee. Add bay leaf, cardamom pods, cinnamon, and cloves. Let them release their aroma for 30 seconds, stirring constantly.",
      "Sauté the onions: Add diced onions and cook for 6-7 minutes until golden brown and caramelized. This builds the flavor foundation of your sauce.",
      "Create the base: Add ginger-garlic paste and cook for 2 minutes. Pour in tomato puree and simmer for 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally. The sauce should darken slightly and the oil should separate from the tomatoes.",
      "Build the sauce: Add kasuri methi, crushing it between your palms to release flavor. Add honey/sugar to balance the acidity of tomatoes. Stir well.",
      "Combine and simmer: Return the seared chicken to the pan. Reduce heat to medium and simmer for 12-15 minutes until chicken is cooked through and sauce has thickened slightly.",
      "Finish with cream and butter: Turn heat to low. Add butter in small pieces, stirring until melted. Slowly pour in cream while stirring to create a silky sauce. Don't boil after adding cream - just heat through.",
      "Final seasoning: Add green chilies, adjust salt and spice level. Simmer for 2-3 more minutes. The sauce should coat the back of a spoon.",
      "Garnish and serve: Top with fresh cilantro and a dollop of cream. Serve immediately with basmati rice, naan, or roti."

    "whyItWorks": "This recipe succeeds through three key techniques: First, marinating in yogurt tenderizes the chicken while adding flavor depth. Second, the two-stage cooking (searing then slow-cooking) develops complex flavors through Maillard reaction on the chicken and caramelization of onions. Third, the spice-tempering technique releases essential oils and aromatics that infuse the entire dish. The balance of tangy yogurt, acidic tomatoes, sweet honey, and rich butter creates a sauce that's greater than the sum of its parts.",
    "commonMistakes": [
      "Not marinating long enough: Aim for at least 30 minutes; overnight is better. This is crucial for tender, flavorful chicken.",
      "Overcooking the chicken: Chicken dries out easily. Sear just until golden, then finish cooking in the sauce.",
      "Boiling the cream: High heat will curdle the cream and break the sauce. Always add cream at the end on low heat.",
      "Skipping the spice-tempering: Don't skip the initial blooming of cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves - this is where half the flavor comes from.",
      "Using low-quality spices: Use fresh, good-quality spices. Stale spices will result in a flat-tasting curry.",
      "Not caramelizing the onions: Rushing this step means missing out on deep, sweet flavors. Take your time here.",
      "Adding yogurt directly to hot pan: Always marinate separately to avoid curdling. Keep yogurt additions cold.",
      "Insufficient salt: Taste as you go. Indian cooking requires proper seasoning to bring out all the spice notes."

    "storageTips": [
      "Refrigerator: Store in an airtight container for up to 3 days. The flavors actually improve slightly as it sits.",
      "Freezer: This dish freezes beautifully. Cool completely, then transfer to freezer bags or containers for up to 3 months. Freeze without rice or naan.",
      "Separating components: For best results when freezing, separate chicken from sauce slightly, ensuring liquid covers chicken to prevent freezer burn.",
      "Containers: Use glass or BPA-free plastic for storage. Avoid storing in metal containers as the acidity may react with metals over time."
    ],
    "reheatingTips": [
      "Stovetop (best method): Add a splash of water or cream to prevent sticking. Heat on medium for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally until heated through. This maintains the sauce's silky texture.",
      "Microwave: Transfer to a microwave-safe dish, cover loosely, and heat for 2-3 minutes, stirring halfway through. Add a splash of cream if sauce seems too thick.",
      "From frozen: Thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then reheat using stovetop method. Or reheat directly from frozen on medium-low heat for 12-15 minutes, stirring frequently.",
      "Important: Never boil the reheated dish as this may cause separation of cream and butter. Gentle heating preserves the luxurious texture."

    "variations": [
      "Spicy Version: Increase red chili powder to 2 teaspoons, add 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, and include 2 fresh red chilies. Add these at the beginning for a slow build of heat rather than sharp spice.",
      "Low-Calorie Version: Use Greek yogurt instead of cream, reduce butter to 2 tablespoons, and use chicken breast (already lower in fat). Nutrition drops to approximately 380 calories while maintaining flavor through extra spices.",
      "High-Protein Version: Use 1.5 kg chicken, increase Greek yogurt in marinade, and use full-fat Greek yogurt instead of cream. Adds 15g protein per serving without significantly increasing calories.",
      "Cottage Cheese Version: Substitute half the chicken with paneer (cottage cheese) cubes. Add paneer in the last 3 minutes to prevent it from becoming rubbery.",
      "Coconut Cream Version: Replace heavy cream with coconut cream for a Southeast Asian twist. Reduce butter slightly and add 1 teaspoon coconut extract for authenticity.",
      "Extra Creamy Version: Increase cream to 250ml and butter to 5 tablespoons for extra richness. Slightly reduce cooking time to prevent over-reduction.",
      "Quick Version: Use chicken thighs instead of breast (naturally more moist and forgiving), reduce marinade time to 15 minutes minimum, and use 2 cans of tomato sauce instead of cooking down tomatoes.",
      "Restaurant Style: Double the butter and cream, add 1/4 teaspoon of saffron threads soaked in warm milk, and garnish with edible gold leaf or dried rose petals for special occasions."
